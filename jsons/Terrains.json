    // Modders take heed:
    // * This never exists on the map, it's a placeholder to allow you to mod the actual river's stats.
    // * The name is hardcoded to apply stats and the Stats Unique when a tile has one or more edges with an actual river.
    // * No other Unique is implemented and will work - for now.
